# unibo__projects__unibo-SAFARI-outputs
Outputs from executing ranflood's SAFARI (outs and logs).

## Files

*	[analyzer/](analyzer) : output of analyzer (manually downloaded from the remote machine running it)
*	[ansible/](ansible) : output of ansible, specifically of the filechecker instances
*	[average/](average) : output of (python) avreages scripts (manually written down from the scripts outputs)
*	[doc/](doc) : notes
*	[scripts/](scripts) : output of scripts (e.g. printed output of `launch` scripts)

### Ansible output

The output of the filechecker follows this hierarchy:
*	ransomware name (e.g. [ansible/Ransomware.WannaCry/](ansible/Ransomware.WannaCry/)) - subfolder automatically created from the exact name of the ransomware executable/archive;
*	some name to specify the kind of test (e.g. [ansible/Ransomware.WannaCry/1s-5shards/](ansible/Ransomware.WannaCry/1s-5shards/)) - either created manually, or through scipts such as `group-tests.sh`;  
*	IP address of the VM that filechecker was run on;
*	full hierarchy of the path containing all the outputs on the VM (by default, each filechecker VM stores the output directory in `/home/checker/`);
*	test folder, automatically named as a timestamp.

The timestamp naming assures that, even if the same VM was to execute more tests, these would display as different output directories (i.e. timestamps), although inside the same IP directory.  

More in detail, each output folder contains these files:
*	`cleanWindowsChecksum` : checksum created through a ranflood snapshot, before an attack (on the infected VM)
*	`log_daemon<TIMESTAMP_INFECTED>.txt` : log of the ranflood daemon (on the infected VM), during the attack
*	`log<TIMESTAMP_INFECTED>.txt` : log of the ansible playbook run internally, on the infected VM, during the attack
*	`log<TIMESTAMP_CHECKER>.txt` : log of the filechecker, during the check/restore command execution
*	`out<TIMESTAMP_CHECKER>.txt` : terminal output of the filechecker's check/restore command
*	`report-shards<TIMESTAMP_CHECKER>` : additional report generated by the filechecker's restore command, containing info on created and corrupted SSS shards
*	`report<TIMESTAMP_CHECKER>` : final report generated by the filechecker's check/restore command

A `timestamp` is generated at each execution of the `launch.sh` or `launch-ansible.sh` command (namely by `generate.sh`) - either in infected or checker mode -, thus:
*	the timestamp naming the folder is that of the filechecker
*	`TIMESTAMP_INFECTED` and `TIMESTAMP_CHECKER` are always different (and the infected one comes first)
